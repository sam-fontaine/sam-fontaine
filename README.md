# 👋 Hi, I'm Sam!
I'm a data analyst who loves building systems that make complex information clear and actionable. My background spans data infrastructure, UX research, and web design, which means I approach problems with both technical precision and an eye for usability.

### 🔧 What I Work On
* Designing databases and pipelines that make research and business data easier to query and scale
* Turning raw data into dashboards, visualizations, and insights that support decision-making
* Leading UX research and prototyping to ensure data products are intuitive and human-centered
* Collaborating across disciplines, from engineers and clinicians to designers and product teams

### 📊 Skills & Tools
* __Languages & Databases__: SQL (Postgres, MySQL), Python, Bash
* __Visualization & Analytics__: Tableau, SPSS
* __UX Research__: survey design (Qualtrics, Google Forms), A/B testing, usability studies, wireframing
* __Other__: Agile workflows, cross-functional collaboration, business storytelling

### 🌟 Highlights
* Developed data pipelines at Mount Sinai that cut processing time by 80%
* Built a SQL-based research database (1,000+ participant records) adopted across multiple studies
* Authored standard operating procedures and onboarding guides used center-wide
* Designed websites and brand assets for fintech and small businesses, blending data with visual storytelling
* Led UX research for two mobile apps, running iterative interviews, A/B tests, and prototypes to guide product roadmaps

### 🖼️  Beyond Work
When I'm not analyzing data, you'll probably find me bouldering, writing poetry, or experimenting with photography and collage art. I love exploring projects that sit at the intersection of creativity and problem-solving.
